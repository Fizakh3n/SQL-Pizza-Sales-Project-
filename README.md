- Grouping data by date using GROUP BY clause to calculate total revenue per day.<br>

•Data Joins:<br>
-The script performs multiple JOIN operations to link tables (order_details,  pizzas, orders) based on pizza_id and order_id.<br>

•Revenue Calculation:
- The calculation of revenue is performed by multiplying quantity from order_details with price from the pizzas table.<br>

Skills Involved:<br>
